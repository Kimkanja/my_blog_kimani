        <h2>Get Together With Friends</h2>
        <p><b>2nd March 2024</b></p>
        <p>I went to the City-Center Mall to meet up with my friends from the past. It have been long since we had a get together. Staying for over an year without meeting each other, we had alot to tell each other. It was fun having such kinda friends in life.</p>
    

        <h2>Went For Camping</h2>
        <p><b>3rd March 2024</b></p>
        <p>Went camping at Lake Shotwell for the night with friends. I loved the smell of the campfire and the taste of roasted, actually burnt marshmallows. I can still smell the pine trees. I wonder if i should ask if we can go to the lake again! Maybe I should just let them surprise me. We've always had a great vacations and they always planned them.</p>

        <p><b>5th March 2024</b></p>

        <p><b>7th March 2024</b></p>
        <p>I love racing sports car. i enjoy the engine revving as the the car drifts. I went to the park where the racing sports was held. it really hit my nerve as i was enjoying the veiw. 'Mike Jason' my favourite driver, he drifts it well and i enjoy everything about him starting from his lifestyle to his career. This time round it so suddenly he didn't make to the Arena, though i had to watch the rest of the racing as i had my ticket purchased already.    </p>
